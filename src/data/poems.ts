Cherry blossoms bloom in pink and white.  
Your eyes like stars, your smile a beam,  
Wearing pink, youâ€™re my sweetest dream.  
  
That kurti sways in morning breeze,  
And time with you feels soft as peace.  
Your stupid-cute face, it makes me grin,  
In your laughter, love begins.`,

With laughter soaking through our hair.

With you, the world just sings along.

We twirled through puddles, what a sight!  
So *pyara*, pure, and full of grace,  
The rain fell soft on your sweet face.`,

A waltz to last through every spring.`,
